# sd-cpp-cuda pins the exact runtime packages it needs rather than pulling
# NVIDIA's cuda-libraries metapackage, which would add about 1.2 GB of unused
# libraries. That pin is only correct while the backend links nothing else, and
# nothing else would notice a change: the build container has every CUDA library
# present, so a newly linked one resolves there and the smoke test stays green.
# It would surface only on a user's machine, as a backend that fails to dlopen
# and a silent fall back to CPU. That is the failure NCCL already caused once in
# the sibling llama-cpp-deb repository.
#
# Takes a path to the shared object, or "-" to read sonames from stdin, plus the
# backend kind. Vulkan needs the same guard for the same reason: the LunarG SDK
# is installed on that build runner, so a backend that picked up a shaderc or
# SPIRV-Tools link resolves there and during ldd -r in the smoke test, then
# fails to dlopen on a user's machine and falls back to CPU without saying why.
